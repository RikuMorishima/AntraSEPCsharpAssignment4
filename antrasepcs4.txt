1. Describe the problem generics address.
	Generics address the problem of potentially having a lot of redundant methods/classes because the only difference 
	of those methods/classes are the datatype they use.
2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
	List<string> strings = new List<string>();
3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
	2
4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
	False
5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
	Add(T entity)
6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
	Clear() removes all entities from a list,
	Remove(T) removes one item
7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
	Using <T> next to the class name.
8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
	False
9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
	true
10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
	True
